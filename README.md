# pair with kay :sparkling_heart:

I like to pair with people. It's nice and fun.

I mostly value sharing and growth.

> The worst thing is how intellectually isolated we all are, how few people there are with whom we can share the insights that we find the most exciting, even among other mathematicians. For me personally I feel very frustrated that there is this huge part of my emotional life that most of the people whom I care about have no access to.

## What to expect from me

* I love variety and different approaches.
* I don't naturally judge things as 'good' or 'bad'.
* I am quite quick.

## If you would like to pair with me

Message me on twitter at [@neoeno](http://www.twitter.com/), or email me at `my_name + "@herostrat.us"`. Tell me a little about your interests and we'll come up with a plan.

I work at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) so I can host there pretty easily, but open to other London or Edinburgh venues (in public/office settings). No remote, and none of my current students please! Do come back when you've got a job, though :dolphin:
